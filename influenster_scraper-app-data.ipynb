They always have sales or deals going on and it's always the place to go when you can't find whatever products you're looking for everywhere else! So many times, we end up going to all of these stores in search of something and go to Meijer last forgetting that it's a hidden gem (the whole store is a hidden gem in my opinion) and of course, lo and behold, there is the exact thing(s) that we've been looking for and THEN SOME! I can't get enough of going there for all of our supplies. I'm a makeup junkie so it's always fun to shop the beauty section in Meijer! I just found out they carry Essence and I about went crazy makeup shopping that section! I love the Meijer brand products as well because you can't tell a difference between name brand and Meijer brand and the Meijer brand always is a good price. I've never been disappointed. The customer service is amazing too! I remember when we first started with our Meijer credit card, for some reason, it said we had $900 worth of credit so we got a couple of carts and bought groceries for the next few months. We got up to the register and it said the balance was $0. Over and over they tried to fix it and it just wouldn't work. So, they ended up just ringing it up and THEY paid for our $738 of groceries! Talk about a great holiday gift (it was December when this happened). I honestly will always love Meijer. The staff is always kind and you get to know them pretty quickly especially when you go in there as much as we do. Anyway, if you can't tell by my review, I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! review_date: None reviewer_name: Ams F. reviewer_loc: Battle Ground, IN likes: ['1'] reviewer_link: https://www.influenster.com/amsfrazier\n",

If you need a couple of things and not have to worry about being on a budget then this is a fine store but if you are on a tight budget I wouldn't recommend this store unless you need a quick pick me up at 12:00am. review_date: None reviewer_name: Stephanie N. reviewer_loc: Kentwood, MI likes: ['1'] reviewer_link: https://www.influenster.com/stephaniendced\n",

I shopped there whenever I was in Ohio. Meijer is one of the most complete super markets ever. They carry a huge variety of products. I especially love their store brand. I save so much money when I shop there. My favorite are the meijers that carry clothes, shoes, and everything for the home. I have to drive to Arlington Heights but it's worth it. I currently live in Chicago and don't mind the drive. I lived in Berwyn and was in heaven when Meijer came a few years ago. They also have amazing overnight diapers for kids. review_date: None reviewer_name: Zayda P. reviewer_loc: Chicago, IL likes: ['1'] reviewer_link: https://www.influenster.com/zaydap1\n",

Covid 19 has greatly impacted our food shopping. Although we’ve successfully used Walmart’s online process we were unable to get fresh food online so we decided to try Meijer’s. After many hours on their site we finalized the shopping cart, only to realize that there were no days available and was told to check back in a day. It was apparent that the only way of getting a slot was by requesting soon after midnight. We missed the first midnight “ lottery” but was successful in snagging a cancellation slot the next day. Our assumption was that demand for this service was high and this was the new normal. Not so.Sometime the next day we received a text that stated our window for pickup was 4 pm to 5 pm that day. An hour window? Did that mean be at the store at four and wait an hour ? Or be there closer to five and not wait ? The store is 30 minutes away. So I left early, and while on the way received a text that our order was now delayed now by another hour. Having errands to run, I utilized the time, but got another text for a new hour reschedule. My wife , at home called Meijer customer service and was put on hold. I went back to Mejier’s and waited. There were no cars in the pick-up lanes, so how could there be delays? Where was demand? Then I got even another text to reschedule now for a 10 pm-11pm window. Our order was now four hours late, so I left. My wife was still on hold with customer service by the time I got home.Finally, the Meijer’s rep answered, and said this, “ What I tell all people who are having this problem is not to leave home until you hear from your personal shopper.” Really? Personal shopper? Not a word about this on the web site.If her words had been on the Meijer’s website, I would not have left home when I did. Simple. I would not have wasted so much time at a time when actually staying at home is advised by the State.I blame Mejier’s and their absolutely inadequate website for this lack of communication. This caused us more stress than if we’d actually gone into the store, taking albeit a small risk, BUT never really knowing either way. These are our times now.This could have been avoided simply by basic clear instructions. This is the fault of Mejier’s management. Not its workers. We’ll stay with Walmart’s online shopping. review_date: None reviewer_name: member-b5b03 reviewer_loc: None likes: [] reviewer_link: https://www.influenster.com/member-b5b03\n",

I actually find really cute clothes at Meijer! Just today I was wearing jeans that I got there and thinking how much I liked the fit, feel, cut, etc. This is something I have noticed consistently over the years, that some of my best finds for dressing myself have been there. I fondly recall jeans 👖 I had years ago that came with the trendiest belt; I always got compliments on those jeans with that belt. I have acquired cute blouses there too but the jeans stick out in my mind more. I get stuff I love ❤️ without spending a fortune. I have their credit card and an app to add their coupons and store virtual copies of my receipts. I never have to worry about losing my receipts! And with Mperks I save a lot of money 💰 each year. I do some of my best Christmas shopping 🛍 there. They have something for everyone. They carry Skechers shoes which I have always found comfortable, and Adidas that my teenage daughters currently like. I got great house slippers last year, with arch support I need, and awesome winter boots for myself this year, which were a lifesaver when it snowed and also were compliment grabbers! I can get just about anything I need. They have even started carrying some higher end beauty products like philosophy. They have household goods, toys 🧸, and even groceries. The grocery department even has stuff I don’t find other places! They leave something to be desired when it comes to looking online for stuff though. I don’t like that they don’t seem to have the website organized well and it appeared as if you couldn’t do online shopping and have stuff shipped to your home last I knew. I overlook this because of the great selections, the savings I rack up, and other convenient features like the hours. Where I live Meijer is open 24 hours. Another feature that is a winner with my child and fellow moms alike is “Sandy” the horse 🐴, sort of like a carousel horse, that kids can ride for one penny. You heard that right! One penny! Oh and the Meijer closest to my home makes the absolute best cakes in their bakery. I got one for my daughter’s second birthday with the whipped icing and we have gotten our cakes 🎂 there for any occasion, or no occasion, ever since. The customer service department aims to please for the most part too. Any time I have had to return something or have a price adjusted because I forgot to give them my coupon, or whatever reason, they have been helpful. I only wish they would’ve kept their fine jewelry dept. I got lovely tenth carat diamond 💎 necklaces for my young teen daughters one Christmas 🎄 a few years back and at a wonderful price. My Meijer store is clean, cheerful, and a bit nicer in every way than any store I have ever been to that had clothes, household goods, groceries, a pharmacy, etc. review_date: None reviewer_name: Heather M. reviewer_loc: Fairborn, OH likes: [] reviewer_link: https://www.influenster.com/heatherm5c63\n",

They took away my ability to do my entire cart, check out by myself, and do it as quickly as possible. Now they only have 20 items or less self scans and people that patrol them if you have more than 20 items. I noticed some people this might not be a big deal, but for people like me who have to get in and get out and are often times very sick from their medications, waiting in line and having to deal with more people than necessary is a huge burden. I went from shopping there multiple times per week down to only going if I absolutely have to… About once every other week. I like their rewards program, I think it’s decent, but I can’t have my time compromised when I go into a store. If you have lots of time to waste, and don’t mind standing in line for literally an hour because they only have four checkout lanes open with real people, then you won’t hate it so bad. As for me, they really screwed up. review_date: None reviewer_name: Paige .. reviewer_loc: None likes: [] reviewer_link: https://www.influenster.com/seekingalexandria\n"

My Meijer is always well stocked, clean, and has lots of great options for pretty much everything. I buy everything from beauty to clothes, groceries, tech, lifestyle, and anything else I could possibly need! I really love their produce section. I have a liver problem that requires lots of healthy food, and I always have lots of great options to pick from. They have healthy snacks outside of the produce aisle that I love too. Meijer's prices fit our budget well and I enjoy shopping there. My only complaint is there never seems to be any aisles open! The self checkout runs slowly and seems to have technical issues. There's always a million of those open, but the actual registers never seem to be!

The produce section is always stocked with fresh fruits & veggies. I prefer their meats to almost any other store I've shopped at because they are always fresh, taste great & are high quality. I always look forward to the weekly ads like the select 10 for 10 items get one free. The milk is decently priced. The big cans of coffee (Foldgers, Meijer brand, ect) are almost always on sale. And I really like if I end up buying Meijer Brand of anything in grocery, it always tastes good. (Which is awesome because with most store brands, not everything tastes that great) I take advantage of their MPerks rewards program, which makes trying to shop with coupons and deals, a lot easier. When it comes to non food item's, some are rather expensive but I usually almost always find really good deals. Like around this last Christmas I was doing some Christmas shopping and found that they had BOGO free boots, so I got my fiance and I boots and it only cost $30 for two pairs. Also, they had nice fleece zip up jackets BOGO free so I grabbed one fleece & one zip up hoody for only $26 altogether. I always see clothes & other items on clearance. I also always order my children's birthday cakes there, which always turn out great & taste good! I find that the coupons that print out after you pay are pretty good, I have gotten 3 coupons now that gave me $10 free dollars off my next shopping trip of $10 or less! And the pharmacy coupons are even better, a few times I got a coupon for a $20 Meijer gift card the next time I filled a prescription there, and used the gift card at Meijer gas station to fill my truck with gas. Which is a pretty decent deal if you ask me! I've never had another store just randomly give out those kind of coupons! Amazing! review_date: None reviewer_name: Alisha S. reviewer_loc: Battle Creek, MI likes: [] reviewer_link: https://www.influenster.com/alishadcbe7\n",

They're MPerks app is awesome and is a great tool to save some money and earn rewards, they still offer great things for my son like a free cookie from the bakery and a penny horse ride when we leave the checkout. The staff is always friendly, the store is always clean, the prices are super competitive, (I save more money shopping here than at Walmart or Kroger, imo) and I ALWAYS find what I'm looking for! Their only downfall is that there are not more stores - so when we go south on vacation we have to shop elsewhere. review_date: None reviewer_name: Jenn O. reviewer_loc: Pleasant Hill, OH likes: [] reviewer_link: https://www.influenster.com/jovenshire\n",

It was my go to store for groceries/health & beauty products. However, the prices have gone up considerably compared to other area grocery stores. Their produce section used to be top notch, but lately, I haven't found the produce to be of any better quality than other stores. Their store brand deli meats are pretty good, but I can get better in-house smoked/roasted items at another local store for less. They do, however, have a great meat department and the double-your-money-back guarantee on their meat is great! review_date: None reviewer_name: Michelle J. reviewer_loc: None likes: [] reviewer_link: https://www.influenster.com/michellejd279\n",

I am originally from Michigan and I am now living in the DC area. I miss Meijer! In college, I would go to Meijer and choose to buy the \"discounted produce\". This produce was always really good, and was fine if you cooked it within a couple of days. I love that Meijer does not throw away their produce that has been there a few days, but instead sells it at lower prices. This is how, when I was a poor college kid, I was able to eat plenty of fresh produce. :) I think Meijer is great! review_date: None reviewer_name: Emily N. reviewer_loc: Alexandria, VA likes: [] reviewer_link: https://www.influenster.com/lutkenhoff\n",

I would have to say that I miss Meijer a lot. Most other stores just don't even come close to it. They always have a great selection and are open 24 hours, which is super convenient. Used to be my go-to store and I would wind up there a couple days out of the week even though it was a bit of a drive to get there. Their produce was awesome, and their store brand products were usually just as good, if not better than a lot of name brand products, but at a cheaper price. MPerks saved my family a lot of money and that was super cool. I wish we had a Meijer around here.

I knew Fred Meijer myself and he was a great man. Very funny and blessed with a great company. They employ so many people in the area. Not to mention, the store itself is a very convenient one stop shop. They have just about anything you may be looking for. Fresh produce, clothing, car stereo parts, and toys. I love all the options they offer their customers. review_date: None reviewer_name: Alyssa D. reviewer_loc: Rockford, MI likes: [] reviewer_link: https://www.influenster.com/uhlisuh\n",

What a great way to save money! I almost feel like I am one of those coupon people when I see the savings. You can use coupons along with whatever you clip from the mperks site. This works great with their 10 for $10 get the 11th item free sales. Not to mention the mperks rewards. I save about $20 a month just using those. The only downside is they do not always have sale items in stock and employees are not always in the know. I grocery shop once a week and do not have a lot of time yet still I found the time to save $260 this month alone on groceries using the mperks and in store savings.

I can't get enough of going there for all of our supplies. I'm a makeup junkie so it's always fun to shop the beauty section in Meijer! I just found out they carry Essence and I about went crazy makeup shopping that section! I love the Meijer brand products as well because you can't tell a difference between name brand and Meijer brand and the Meijer brand always is a good price. I've never been disappointed. The customer service is amazing too! I remember when we first started with our Meijer credit card, for some reason, it said we had $900 worth of credit so we got a couple of carts and bought groceries for the next few months. We got up to the register and it said the balance was $0. Over and over they tried to fix it and it just wouldn't work. So, they ended up just ringing it up and THEY paid for our $738 of groceries! Talk about a great holiday gift (it was December when this happened). I honestly will always love Meijer.

Covid 19 has greatly impacted our food shopping. Although we’ve successfully used Walmart’s online process we were unable to get fresh food online so we decided to try Meijer’s. After many hours on their site we finalized the shopping cart, only to realize that there were no days available and was told to check back in a day. It was apparent that the only way of getting a slot was by requesting soon after midnight. We missed the first midnight “ lottery” but was successful in snagging a cancellation slot the next day. Our assumption was that demand for this service was high and this was the new normal. Not so.Sometime the next day we received a text that stated our window for pickup was 4 pm to 5 pm that day. An hour window? Did that mean be at the store at four and wait an hour ? Or be there closer to five and not wait ? The store is 30 minutes away. So I left early, and while on the way received a text that our order was now delayed now by another hour. Having errands to run, I utilized the time, but got another text for a new hour reschedule. My wife , at home called Meijer customer service and was put on hold. I went back to Mejier’s and waited. There were no cars in the pick-up lanes, so how could there be delays? Where was demand? Then I got even another text to reschedule now for a 10 pm-11pm window. Our order was now four hours late, so I left. My wife was still on hold with customer service by the time I got home.Finally, the Meijer’s rep answered, and said this, “ What I tell all people who are having this problem is not to leave home until you hear from your personal shopper.” Really? Personal shopper? Not a word about this on the web site.If her words had been on the Meijer’s website, I would not have left home when I did. Simple. I would not have wasted so much time at a time when actually staying at home is advised by the State.I blame Mejier’s and their absolutely inadequate website for this lack of communication. This caused us more stress than if we’d actually gone into the store, taking albeit a small risk, BUT never really knowing either way. These are our times now.This could have been avoided simply by basic clear instructions. This is the fault of Mejier’s management. Not its workers.

I have their credit card and an app to add their coupons and store virtual copies of my receipts. I never have to worry about losing my receipts! And with Mperks I save a lot of money 💰 each year. I do some of my best Christmas shopping 🛍 there. They have something for everyone. They carry Skechers shoes which I have always found comfortable, and Adidas that my teenage daughters currently like. I got great house slippers last year, with arch support I need, and awesome winter boots for myself this year, which were a lifesaver when it snowed and also were compliment grabbers! I can get just about anything I need. They have even started carrying some higher end beauty products like philosophy. They have household goods, toys \\U0001f9f8, and even groceries. The grocery department even has stuff I don’t find other places! They leave something to be desired when it comes to looking online for stuff though. I don’t like that they don’t seem to have the website organized well and it appeared as if you couldn’t do online shopping and have stuff shipped to your home last I knew. I overlook this because of the great selections, the savings I rack up, and other convenient features like the hours. Where I live Meijer is open 24 hours. Another feature that is a winner with my child and fellow moms alike is “Sandy” the horse 🐴, sort of like a carousel horse, that kids can ride for one penny. You heard that right! One penny! Oh and the Meijer closest to my home makes the absolute best cakes in their bakery. I got one for my daughter’s second birthday with the whipped icing and we have gotten our cakes 🎂 there for any occasion, or no occasion, ever since. The customer service department aims to please for the most part too. Any time I have had to return something or have a price adjusted because I forgot to give them my coupon, or whatever reason, they have been helpful. I only wish they would’ve kept their fine jewelry dept. I got lovely tenth carat diamond 💎 necklaces for my young teen daughters one Christmas 🎄 a few years back and at a wonderful price. My Meijer store is clean, cheerful, and a bit nicer in every way than any store I have ever been to that had clothes, household goods, groceries, a pharmacy, etc.', 'review_date': None, 'reviewer_name': 'Heather M.', 'reviewer_loc': 'Fairborn, OH', 'likes': [], 'reviewer_link': 'https://www.influenster.com/heatherm5c63'}, {'review_id': ['48582163'], 'review_link': 'https://www.influenster.com/reviews/meijer/48582163', 'product_link': 'https://www.influenster.com/reviews/meijer', 'review_text': 'I love meijer so much.

The produce section is always stocked with fresh fruits & veggies. I prefer their meats to almost any other store I've shopped at because they are always fresh, taste great & are high quality. I always look forward to the weekly ads like the select 10 for 10 items get one free. The milk is decently priced. The big cans of coffee (Foldgers, Meijer brand, ect) are almost always on sale. And I really like if I end up buying Meijer Brand of anything in grocery, it always tastes good. (Which is awesome because with most store brands, not everything tastes that great) I take advantage of their MPerks rewards program, which makes trying to shop with coupons and deals, a lot easier. When it comes to non food item's, some are rather expensive but I usually almost always find really good deals. Like around this last Christmas I was doing some Christmas shopping and found that they had BOGO free boots, so I got my fiance and I boots and it only cost $30 for two pairs. Also, they had nice fleece zip up jackets BOGO free so I grabbed one fleece & one zip up hoody for only $26 altogether. I always see clothes & other items on clearance. I also always order my children's birthday cakes there, which always turn out great & taste good! I find that the coupons that print out after you pay are pretty good, I have gotten 3 coupons now that gave me $10 free dollars off my next shopping trip of $10 or less! And the pharmacy coupons are even better, a few times I got a coupon for a $20 Meijer gift card the next time I filled a prescription there, and used the gift card at Meijer gas station to fill my truck with gas. Which is a pretty decent deal if you ask me! I've never had another store just randomly give out those kind of coupons!

They occasionally have a coupon for $20 when refilling a prescription from the Pharmacy which is a nice bonus.\\n\\nOne of the increasingly strong points of Meijer is their organic and international sections. It varies store to store, but I've generally been impressed by their selection of products that will cost you $1 extra at Whole Foods.\", 'review_date': None, 'reviewer_name': 'Sean H.', 'reviewer_loc': None, 'likes': [], 'reviewer_link': 'https://www.influenster.com/seanh7869'}, {'review_id': ['4190338'], 'review_link': 'https://www.influenster.com/reviews/meijer/4190338', 'product_link': 'https://www.influenster.com/reviews/meijer', 'review_text': 'Meijer is always very clean and the produce is shiny, fresh with excellent presentation.
