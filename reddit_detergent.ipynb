      "+ Fele played in Matic role and did it flawlessly. He cancelled out all the Burnley's long balls and protected our back from ariel threats, which is their weakness.\n",
      "+ We do a lot of runs, so Pogba could ping long balls all over the field with terrific accuracy.\n",
      "- Fred should have played the position that Matic did today. Matic was not quick enough so it slowed down our counterattack many times.\n",
      "3. Defense:\n",
      "+ Lindelof building up his confidence again. Position himself well and was willing to pass foward.\n",
      "+ Smalling did nothing wrong. Still looks uncomfortable with the ball but had no bad decision.\n",

      "&gt;it's fucking United\n",
      "\n",
      "If history and prestige won matches, the league would go to United every season. 'it's United' means nothing. It meant nothing with Moyes, LVG, and same now. \n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;They still had a ton of attacking threats available.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Fifa and on paper, sure. \n",
      "\n",
      "In reality, Martial has a ways to go yet before he can impose himself on the game, as we saw clearly today. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lukaku missed his one clear shot on goal sending it straight at the keeper, and was abnormally abysmal at winning ariel duels and protecting the ball. \n",
      "\n",
      "Mkhitaryan was invisible today. I've said this many times, I think he is a great player when backed up by very good midfield dominance, but he is too easily nullified. He was in Henderson, Can or Wjinaldum's pocket all game, they passed him around like a bus pass. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ashley Young is a very serviceable, admirable player, but he has no business being the starting right winger for United. And somehow he outperformed Martial and Lukaku by a comfortable margin. \n",
      "\n",
      "Herrera is a wonderful player at what he does (tackling, marking, man-marking, energy, tenacity) but he brings very little in forward progress. He is poor against press and when pressured, and showed it today when he lost at least three balls when pressed. His short passing is good, but he is not a midfield orchestrator. \n",
      "\n",
      "Matic is a more complete version of Herrera, he is a perfect complement to a player like Pogba. But he can't be relied on to be the creative engine to move a team forward. He tried his best today, but you're asking a CDM to be the most creative player in a midfield frequently outnumbered by 2-to-1 when Coutinho slid deeper. He is a perfect piece for Jose but let's not forget he was banished to the bench for a majority of last year. He's worthy of a starting place for a club like United, but he shouldn't be the best player on the pitch. Perfect complement player, struggles when he is relied on as the main piece, and rightfully so. \n",
      "\n",
      "Darmian is a solid player, but honestly has no business starting for a top 4 side. He is fairly good defensively, but has nothing to give going forward. The game has changed considerably and the fullback position arguably has evolved the most. If your fullback is a liability going forward, you are essentially cutting your width on the entire left side. Reducing width has immense impact on how your opponents press you, and how much risk they take with their own wide players. Leftback and lack of width on the left is a monumental weakness for United and will continue to be. \n",
      "\n",
      "Jones is worthy of his place but Smalling is not. I'm sorry, but he, like Darmian, is clearly not close to top 4 starting place material. \n",
      "\n",
      "Valencia is a top right back, I have little complaint with him. Though his production from the wide areas is sometimes criticized, I think he's the type of player that United could win a title with. His weaknesses are minimal and he is incredibly consistent. \n",
      "\n",
      "DDG is not a human being. He is easily United's best player on any given day as his consistency and level of quality are hardly matched by any other player in the world. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, by my count, United today (in terms of talent) fielded 1 world class player in DDG, 1 immense player with world class potential in Lukaku, and 1 player who may not be considered world class but would start in probably every top 6 side in Valencia. The rest are players who have shown flashes of brilliance, but do not show that quality with any consistency against top sides. Martial, Mkhi, Matic, Herrera are all great players to have in a squad, but that isn't a core that will go to Anfield and snatch a fixture with beautiful, fluid, or even convincing play. \n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;United was tied for first before this game. They'd won 6 from 7 games.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure, but every team they throttled were at least a tier lower than Liverpool in terms of talent. You're very excited about wins from teams that were all 10th place or lower. Take Jose's advice when he said don't get too excited about the start.  \n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;There is no logical reason as to why they wouldn't have thought \"We can get 3 points today\". \n",
      "\n",
      "Sure there are and I mentioned a few of them. It seems Jose is one of the few people that understands the many limitations of his squad. While many are ready to heap mountains of expectations on United, I think he sees his team sheet with the likes of Ashley Young, a young Martial with much improvement left in his game, Lukaku who has struggled against big clubs, Herrera who does not possess an attacking game, Darmian responsible for giving him width, Smalling starting at CB (I mean honestly, let's get a grip here) and thinks that a number of these players wouldn't see a sniff of playing time as starters at Chelsea, City, or even Liverpool. \n",
      "\n",
      "Blame his tactics all you like, but also have a longer look at his players. It's not a coincidence United couldn't finish to save their lives last season, and frankly haven't looked the quality people expect for going on 3+ seasons now, and it might just be who is on the pitch.  - soccer\n",
      "4:  - I doubt you watched bakayoko much at all last season. He is really slow, not a huge Ariel threat and incredibly average with his distribution. He's not a bad midfielder but he's far from a great one and potential wise he has shown nothing dramatic. \n",
      "\n",
      "Comparing him to city, united and Tottenhams midfields he just can compete. I get the age thing but there is no substitute for quality. Sure matic hasn't been at his best for a couple of years and kante draws all the plaudits but his technical ability and height make up for kantes flaws pretty perfectly - soccer\n",
      "5:  - I'll state first that saying 'unlawful limbo' hurts your case as the occupation is considered legal internationally. Of course, the transfer of population according to the Fourth Geneva Convention constitutes a war crime, but to say that Palestine is in an ulawful limbo is untrue.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not so clear-cut as disagree or don't disagree. If I were presented with a referendum, saying, 'effective immediately grant full independence to the West Bank under 1967 lines', I'd vote 'no'. Because that would doom my country because terrorists would destroy Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, as the Gazan terrorists did South Israel after Ariel Sharon disengaged from Gaza and granted the Strip full indepndence (they were in control of their borders and airspace until Hamas took over). Fatah is showing record low support, and it will be simple for Hamas to take the over West Bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "No land in the West Bank was annexed, excluding East Jerusalem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's clarify something--when you're talking about people with 'denied civil rights' and people that cannot reach 'citizen status', do you acknowledge that you're talking about full-citizens of Palestine, and moreover only citizens that are located in Area C of the West Bank? All Palestinians have Palestinian citizenship, and to say that they are denied civil rights is misleading. They enjoy freedom of speech (to the same degree as anyone else here--I believe American freedom of speech laws are quite a bit more bold than European and Israeli speech laws), they enjoy benefits and pretty much everything except freedom of movement. But then again, settlers don't enjoy freedom of movement either. Just like Palestinians can't enter settler towns, the opposite is also true, and just like Palestinians have to go through checkpoints, so do Jews. Soldiers don't have a Jew-o-matic that can tell the difference between an approaching Jewish or Palestinian car. They stop them all the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wasn't comparing Palestine to Canada--I was comparing the invasion of the U.S. in Afghanistan to the occupation of Palestine. The Canada thing was a throwaway statement attempting to stress the ridiculousness of saying that Area A Palestinians don't enjoy the same rights as Israelis in Tel Aviv. Of course they don't. Neither do Lebanese Arabs enjoy the same rights as Egyptian Arabs, and neither do Canadians and Americans. Each have their own laws and government, and just because one country invaded another doesn't mean that suddenly the invaded country has to be the invader's citizens or it's oppression. Else the U.S. would grant citizens to every country it invades, which is a pretty long list.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe you are steering very, very far away from the topic of conversation. Israel does not displace Palestinians and then drop Jews in their towns. I'm not using words of outrage because I'm trying to be civil here--this is *simply untrue*. Sure, Palestinian local resources are being used for Israelis... but Israeli local resources are being used for Palestinians, so what? Palestine is billions in debt to our electric companies. They don't have *one* generator, because their government funds anyone who commits an act of terror instead of investing in a power station.\n",
      "\n",
      "You're talking in very wide reaching words and painting it as though Israel tortures random people and military orders are common. They are **not**. You are talking about different things and moreover talking about lonesome incidents as though they are common practice. Literally one soldier in history has killed a neutralized terrorist and suddenly you're saiyng, 'wounded ones even executed.' The soldier was only a few months back judged guilty and sentenced to 18 months in prison. Furthermore you *neglect* to say that the 'wounded ones' are terrorists--your arguments are extremely dishonest in nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;Also, contrary to what you say, to this day, settlers and Palestinians are subjected to different laws/courts on same crimes. The situation has not changed on that matter. Maybe completely new orders are not given anymore, but old ones are still applied, and people are still treated differently, in different courts, to different laws. \n",
      "\n",
      "Like this paragraph, I am incapable of having a reasonable discussion with you as it feels like you're intentionally being obtuse. You're talking like this situation is applied to every Palestinian--it does not. Only Area C is subject to military orders (and no, there is not one military order that is in effect in Area A where most Palestinians live), and furthermore Palestinians and Israelis alike are subject to the same orders. They do not live under different laws and any security crime will be dealt with in a military court. Military orders go through COGAT into the Administration, and the Administration has been stripped by the Oslo Accords of any power to issue orders in Area A, and orders are only issued to settlers in Area B (while the PA handles the Palestinians in Area B).\n",
      "\n",
      "The only Palestinians subject to martial law are Area C Palestinians, and to call this apartheid is preposterous as Israelis are subject to the same laws. Terrorist are torturred to reveal their fellow conspirators by the Shabak, same deal as the CIA, it doesn't make either the U.S. or Israel apartheid. Nothing has been annexed by Israel in the past 30 years. Most Palestinians are **not** subject to military orders and are instead subject to the government they elected--be it Hamas (Gaza) or Fatah (Area A &amp; B). No Palestinian has been forcefully displaced and a Jewish home was built in his place during the occupation, not one. You sometimes hear that Palestinian homes are destroyed for being built without permits, but [Jews are under the same policy.](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.774747) Here's the latest one I could find in English.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, Israel isn't apartheid for keeping a foreign people under occupation, and the occupation itself is legal under international law. You could say some things about what goes on during the actual occupation, but to complain that Area A Palestinians aren't citizens is as ridiculous as asking why Afghanistan Arabs aren't American citizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conversation is about apartheid--we cannot jump between issue and issue of the occupation, of which there are many to discuss. This thread is about the question of apartheid based on military orders vs civil laws. As you may have read already through the link I provided earlier, the only area where martial law applies (Area C), both Palestinians and Israeli settlers alike are under the exact same laws. Hence, there is no different in social status, especially not based on race, considering Israeli Arabs enjoy the highest quality of life in the Middle East and have indisputable equal rights. - worldnews\n",
      "6:  - What a simplistic opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dude, I know he's a quality player. But our system is different than Barca so I am skeptical when OP can simply said he 'perfectly fits our system'. As far as I know, in our system the wingbacks has to be tall players. That's why Alonso and Moses are chosen. Teams playing us like to dump ball to the left and right wingback areas because going through the middle is tough with Kante and Matic there plus with 3 central defenders. Plus there are times when our wingbacks have to do ariel defend. Even Moses took time to adjust. Having tall wingbacks like Moses and Alonso is also fits our system much better as Courtois often distribute the ball to either side between wingbacks and our short forwards (Pedro and Hazard). So you tell me, how can a midget like Alba 'perfectly fits our system'? Just because he has pace?  - chelseafc\n",

      "Midfield: Also Europe over SA for me. Although SA's duo of James and Di Maria provide more creativity than just Ozil alone, Pogba and Matic offer the physicality (as well as skill) to disrupt their flow. \n",
      "\n",
      "Forwards: SA over Europe, but not by as much as some people in this thread make it out to be. Sure MSN is arguably (I think it's unarguable) the best front three ever to play together, but at their peak, Europe's front three are virtually just as unplayable. They also offer a physicality and ariel threat, with Ronaldo and Benzema, which MSN doesn't. Still, you can't argue against 122 goals in one season, so MSN wins. \n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion: In a one game series, either team could win on any day, as they are both so close in quality. If they were to play a 10 game series though, I'd bet on team Europe to win more than half of the games, due to their superior defense/midfield matching up favorably against SA's attack.    - soccer\n",

      "\n",
      "2. Focus on Defense. A 3rd Choice CB, Two solid, **Interchangable** wing backs would be the best. Pintos is mediocre, but he can only play one side. Getting at least one, perferablely 2 two-footed players would be ideal to cover for injury.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Get some spark in the midfield. We need someone who is strong and confident on the ball, wins ariel battles, and plays a role similar to Matic, and to a limited role, Busquets. We have the creativity with MPG, Shea, and TT. We need a linkup man.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Draft well and promote Youth. TT, Bingham, and Koval need more minutes. Also, we need a draft a gamechanger. Whether it be in defense or offense, it needs to be a player we can utilize to change the game when option A, B, or C doesn't work.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Take time to adjust. We are in the midst of a changing system. We will NOT be a playoff or Shield contender immediately with Dom. Give him 1 season to set what he wants. Then give him 1.5 to get us consistently winning and in the playoffs. Dom can do it, but we ***CANNOT*** jump on his back after 3 months. *We are rebuilding.

      "14:  - Ya, that reason is that English sides are less good with the ball. Technically they are weaker, but they are better at running longer and going into physical challenges. If Barca play Chelsea, Barca will probably have 70% possession. Then look at Barca's players- There is probably only 1 \"tough\" player in the entire Barca team, and thats Mascherano, a guy who incidently played alot of his career in England. Most of Barca's quality is how good they are on the ball, not how good they are physically. On the other hand Chelsea- (Ivanovic, Terry, Cahill, Matic, Luiz, Ramires) \n",
      "\n",
      "This is pretty much a fact. Really you are going to argue that German and Spanish teams are more physcial than English? Theres a different style of play in different regions and Britain (exported to US and Australia/NZ) and Scandinavia have a more physical style of play. With direct wingers, more ariel balls, more goals from set peices etc. With clubs being able to get players and coaches from everywhere, its starting to change at that level, but English clubs still have a different style from continental europe. \n",
      "\n",
